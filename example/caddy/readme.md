# Setup

Pre-requirements:
* have a working [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) instance with an admin API enabled and available at `http://caddy:2019`

Start hosts-generator:
```bash
hosts-generator -watch=true --caddyURL=http://caddy:2019 -file=/etc/hosts -ip=127.0.0.1
```

> Note: replace 127.0.0.1 with caddy IP if needed.

You can check contents of your hosts file now, it should contain the following:
```
######## AUTOGENERATED BY TRAEFIK_HOSTS_GENERATOR ################ 
127.0.0.1	host.com
######## AUTOGENERATED BY TRAEFIK_HOSTS_GENERATOR END ############ 
```

And KubeOps app page should be available at `http://host.com`.
